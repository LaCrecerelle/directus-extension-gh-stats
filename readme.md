# Directus GitHub Repo Statistics Panel

Show statistics from a GitHub repository including stars, issues, and pull requests. 

## Details

This panel uses the GitHub API to show data from a GitHub repository directly in an Directus dashboard.

## Set Up Instructions

Create a personal access token with read access to the repository you want to view on the dashboard. A classic-style PAT with no expiration or scopes is fine. Then add `GITHUB_TOKEN` to your docker-compose.yml environment section.
